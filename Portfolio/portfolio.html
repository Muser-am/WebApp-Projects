    <p>I currently have over a year experience in the field of web development. I began my career as a self-taught programmer, learning HTML and CSS before moving on to more advanced languages such as PHP and MySQL.
I have a passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly websites, and has worked on a wide range of projects for clients in various industries. I am skilled in both front-end and back-end development, and have a strong understanding of web security and database management.

I also involved in the planning and execution of new projects, and works closely with the design and marketing teams to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the client and delivers the best possible user experience.
